I take having fun and quality design equally seriously and my work is dedicated to creating compositions, colour palettes and typography that are fun and harmonious. Working in multimedia methods, I am skilled in traditional, digital and 3D illustration mediums. Whilst studying I have worked as an intern at Smart Casual Gallery, worked as a freelance illustrator and a full-time eyewear stylist (yes, it is a job and no it does not pay well). I plan to publish children’s books and work in branding and packaging, all whilst keeping illustration at the forefront of my work. I am also a public transport enthusiast with a gnarly icecream addiction.

My background in cognitive and social psychology has been enhanced through my study abroad placement, which I pursued in order to better understand human perspectives and decision-making, relative to consumption. My strengths centre around brand development, problem-solving and promotional signage, which have each been demonstrated through multiple internships, Curtin assessments and freelance contracts over the past four years. Post-Curtin, I want to ensure I continue learning and developing myself and skills, meaning that - although I am particularly interested in a brand consultant and creator pathway - I'm not looking for a particular role or agency, but rather a constructive environment that will help me become a great designer and colleague, that can feed back into the industry.","name":{"first":"Sarah","last":"Greening","preferred":"Sarah"},"majors":[{"id":"Q2JKhMh3LUxZjZRXpTvf","title":"Graphic Design"}]},{"name":{"last":"Gunton","first":"Naomi","preferred":""},"social":[{"name":"Artstation","link":"https://www.artstation.com/patribalanovsky"},{"link":"https://www.behance.net/naomigunton","name":"Behance"},{"name":"CGSociety","link":"https://nilbertotawata.cgsociety.org/"},{"link":"https://dribbble.com/kylietimpani","name":"Dribbble"},{"name":"Facebook","link":"https://www.facebook.com/Humaan"},{"name":"GitHub","link":"https://github.com/FrancisVillarba"},{"link":"https://www.instagram.com/curtindesign2020/","name":"Instagram"},{"name":"LinkedIn","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-brouse-7890372a/"},{"name":"Twitter","link":"https://twitter.com/weareanthologie"},{"link":"https://vimeo.com/bphoton","name":"Vimeo"},{"link":"https://www.youtube.com/c/ChilledCow","name":"YouTube"},{"link":"https://bitbucket.org/aj_may/","name":"Bitbucket"},{"link":"https://codepen.io/naomigunton","name":"CodePen"},{"link":"https://polycount.com/profile/discussions/naomiguntonprofile","name":"PolyCount"},{"link":"https://jhnmyr.tumblr.com/","name":"Tumblr"}],"email":"18758083@student.curtin.edu.au","id":"6j15RJQQ1Ynpbtg2O1pU","projects":[{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=119i6xf3k8ILZg3TUFEsuTAxXP_Y6GU7s","alt":"Naomi's Project Preview Image 0"},{"alt":"Naomi's Project Preview Image 1","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b124FeRwbOgpCvfEFllJoUNMhILw5U8W"},{"alt":"Naomi's Project Preview Image 2","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1om9hXdTQTmzYAegY21mG5ZnTv2oE0dZQ"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D98_lJUfgD6EKxVoQyotc-XVCkJtl8lY","alt":"Naomi's Project Preview Image 3"},{"alt":"Naomi's Project Preview Image 4","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FzAHe0_AAECHJj2qca57UCvmXT0Pgzn4"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xJNdw3Lnq-zze8aa-mW9ZGsHcsYNeGTm","alt":"Naomi's Project Preview Image 5"}],"profile":"https://www.dbdigitalcreative.com.au/","majors":[{"id":"Wvll0Lz78WqyUWpZ6qmD","title":"Digital Design"},{"id":"Q2JKhMh3LUxZjZRXpTvf","title":"Graphic Design"}],"bio":"I feel so happy to finally have a university degree. I was awarded the Vice Chancellor's List three times, while juggling parenthood. Right now I'm navigating JavaScript, Node, APIs, SPAs, and git. But, my heart lives on design island. My Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign skills are advanced. I thrive on brand stories, precise vectors, smart type pairings, and colour.\n\nI have harnessed my own brand of creativity that I call The Alexact Method. Years of applying various creative processes has enabled me to define my own method. These steps take us from brief, to pitch - and back again, if needed. I am confident in my ability to apply this method to any brief and solve the problem. I also believe my method can be taught, and am considering running private courses. \n\nWhen I switch off, I love my daughter, my small dog, my husband, RTRFM, WA, meditation, deep sleep, and a cold pint of beer with good mates. Every day at university has been beautiful, and now I am ready to join the Perth design community.","statement":"Solving design problems with precision and tact"},{"projects":[{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=119i6xf3k8ILZg3TUFEsuTAxXP_Y6GU7s","alt":"Jess's Project Preview Image 0"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b124FeRwbOgpCvfEFllJoUNMhILw5U8W","alt":"Jess's Project Preview Image 1"},{"alt":"Jess's Project Preview Image 2","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1om9hXdTQTmzYAegY21mG5ZnTv2oE0dZQ"},{"alt":"Jess's Project Preview Image 3","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D98_lJUfgD6EKxVoQyotc-XVCkJtl8lY"},{"alt":"Jess's Project Preview Image 4","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FzAHe0_AAECHJj2qca57UCvmXT0Pgzn4"},{"alt":"Jess's Project Preview Image 5","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xJNdw3Lnq-zze8aa-mW9ZGsHcsYNeGTm"}],"id":"7VYbfVMLwDj6XcmDGJgS","name":{"last":"Brown","first":"Jess","preferred":"Jess"},"email":"jesspbrown00@gmail.com","profile":"https://www.dbdigitalcreative.com.au/","social":[{"name":"Artstation","link":"https://www.artstation.com/patribalanovsky"},{"name":"Behance","link":"https://www.behance.net/naomigunton"},{"name":"CGSociety","link":"https://nilbertotawata.cgsociety.org/"},{"link":"https://dribbble.com/kylietimpani","name":"Dribbble"},{"link":"https://www.facebook.com/Humaan","name":"Facebook"},{"name":"GitHub","link":"https://github.com/FrancisVillarba"},{"link":"https://www.instagram.com/curtindesign2020/","name":"Instagram"},{"name":"LinkedIn","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-brouse-7890372a/"},{"link":"https://twitter.com/weareanthologie","name":"Twitter"},{"name":"Vimeo","link":"https://vimeo.com/bphoton"},{"link":"https://www.youtube.com/c/ChilledCow","name":"YouTube"},{"name":"Bitbucket","link":"https://bitbucket.org/aj_may/"},{"name":"CodePen","link":"https://codepen.io/naomigunton"},{"name":"PolyCount","link":"https://polycount.com/profile/discussions/naomiguntonprofile"},{"link":"https://jhnmyr.tumblr.com/","name":"Tumblr"}],"statement":"UX Designer is my fancy title for moving pixels back and forth until they make your life easier","majors":[{"id":"Wvll0Lz78WqyUWpZ6qmD","title":"Digital Design"}],"bio":"Caution!

In my spare time, you'll find me at my desk, with a snack, most likely singing along to a musical theatre playlist.","majors":[{"id":"Q2JKhMh3LUxZjZRXpTvf","title":"Graphic Design"}],"name":{"last":"Springate","preferred":"Willow","first":"Willow"},"email":"springywills@hotmail.com","social":[{"link":"https://www.artstation.com/patribalanovsky","name":"Artstation"},{"link":"https://www.behance.net/naomigunton","name":"Behance"},{"name":"CGSociety","link":"https://nilbertotawata.cgsociety.org/"},{"link":"https://dribbble.com/kylietimpani","name":"Dribbble"},{"link":"https://www.facebook.com/Humaan","name":"Facebook"},{"name":"GitHub","link":"https://github.com/FrancisVillarba"},{"name":"Instagram","link":"https://www.instagram.com/curtindesign2020/"},{"name":"LinkedIn","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-brouse-7890372a/"},{"name":"Twitter","link":"https://twitter.com/weareanthologie"},{"name":"Vimeo","link":"https://vimeo.com/bphoton"},{"name":"YouTube","link":"https://www.youtube.com/c/ChilledCow"},{"link":"https://bitbucket.org/aj_may/","name":"Bitbucket"},{"link":"https://codepen.io/naomigunton","name":"CodePen"},{"link":"https://polycount.com/profile/discussions/naomiguntonprofile","name":"PolyCount"},{"name":"Tumblr","link":"https://jhnmyr.tumblr.com/"}],"projects":[{"alt":"Willow's Project Preview Image 0","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=119i6xf3k8ILZg3TUFEsuTAxXP_Y6GU7s"},{"alt":"Willow's Project Preview Image 1","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b124FeRwbOgpCvfEFllJoUNMhILw5U8W"},{"alt":"Willow's Project Preview Image 2","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1om9hXdTQTmzYAegY21mG5ZnTv2oE0dZQ"},{"alt":"Willow's Project Preview Image 3","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D98_lJUfgD6EKxVoQyotc-XVCkJtl8lY"},{"alt":"Willow's Project Preview Image 4","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FzAHe0_AAECHJj2qca57UCvmXT0Pgzn4"},{"alt":"Willow's Project Preview Image 5","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xJNdw3Lnq-zze8aa-mW9ZGsHcsYNeGTm"}],"profile":"https://www.dbdigitalcreative.com.au/"},{"projects":[{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=119i6xf3k8ILZg3TUFEsuTAxXP_Y6GU7s","alt":"Amelia's Project Preview Image 0"},{"alt":"Amelia's Project Preview Image 1","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b124FeRwbOgpCvfEFllJoUNMhILw5U8W"},{"alt":"Amelia's Project Preview Image 2","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1om9hXdTQTmzYAegY21mG5ZnTv2oE0dZQ"},{"alt":"Amelia's Project Preview Image 3","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D98_lJUfgD6EKxVoQyotc-XVCkJtl8lY"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FzAHe0_AAECHJj2qca57UCvmXT0Pgzn4","alt":"Amelia's Project Preview Image 4"},{"alt":"Amelia's Project Preview Image 5","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xJNdw3Lnq-zze8aa-mW9ZGsHcsYNeGTm"}],"statement":"Designer looking for new projects to fall in love with","id":"A86AChDe1JmSq3eeZfI1","majors":[{"id":"Wvll0Lz78WqyUWpZ6qmD","title":"Digital Design"},{"id":"Q2JKhMh3LUxZjZRXpTvf","title":"Graphic Design"}],"name":{"preferred":"Millie","first":"Amelia","last":"Radesich"},"email":"milliefromtherock@gmail.com","bio":"Hi, my name is Amelia, but people from the Rock know me as Millie.\nI'm a Brand & Digital Designer originally from Rockingham.\nI design a broad range of properties (websites, applications & brands) that tend to be more unconventional.\nI'd like to specialise in packaging design and front-end UX & UI.\nI am a fast learner, critical thinker, problem solver, team player.\nI'm looking for work that requires a rebel's touch. \n\nPhhhheww...got my elevator pitch out the way.\nOkay.

My strength lies in weaving immersive narrative through my design with the use of this unified material painting and digital illustrative style; always assuring authentic, aesthetic and singular creations. \n\nCreating unique vessels of communication is my passion, and selling the visual beauty behind a strong narrative is my absolute pleasure.\n","social":[{"name":"Artstation","link":"https://www.artstation.com/patribalanovsky"},{"link":"https://www.behance.net/naomigunton","name":"Behance"},{"link":"https://nilbertotawata.cgsociety.org/","name":"CGSociety"},{"link":"https://dribbble.com/kylietimpani","name":"Dribbble"},{"name":"Facebook","link":"https://www.facebook.com/Humaan"},{"link":"https://github.com/FrancisVillarba","name":"GitHub"},{"name":"Instagram","link":"https://www.instagram.com/curtindesign2020/"},{"name":"LinkedIn","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-brouse-7890372a/"},{"name":"Twitter","link":"https://twitter.com/weareanthologie"},{"link":"https://vimeo.com/bphoton","name":"Vimeo"},{"name":"YouTube","link":"https://www.youtube.com/c/ChilledCow"},{"name":"Bitbucket","link":"https://bitbucket.org/aj_may/"},{"name":"CodePen","link":"https://codepen.io/naomigunton"},{"link":"https://polycount.com/profile/discussions/naomiguntonprofile","name":"PolyCount"},{"name":"Tumblr","link":"https://jhnmyr.tumblr.com/"}],"name":{"preferred":"Nikita","last":"Wynne","first":"Nikita"},"id":"CA0sdE1Xf4msSaL7WNXk","statement":"Passion be my Art"},{"name":{"first":"Michael","last":"Woolcott","preferred":"Michael"},"projects":[{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=119i6xf3k8ILZg3TUFEsuTAxXP_Y6GU7s","alt":"Michael's Project Preview Image 0"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b124FeRwbOgpCvfEFllJoUNMhILw5U8W","alt":"Michael's Project Preview Image 1"},{"alt":"Michael's Project Preview Image 2","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1om9hXdTQTmzYAegY21mG5ZnTv2oE0dZQ"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D98_lJUfgD6EKxVoQyotc-XVCkJtl8lY","alt":"Michael's Project Preview Image 3"},{"alt":"Michael's Project Preview Image 4","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FzAHe0_AAECHJj2qca57UCvmXT0Pgzn4"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xJNdw3Lnq-zze8aa-mW9ZGsHcsYNeGTm","alt":"Michael's Project Preview Image 5"}],"profile":"https://www.dbdigitalcreative.com.au/","bio":"Having completed a Bachelors of Exercise and Sport Science I decided to shift my attention to my other passion of design.

I strive to find interesting solutions to the puzzles presented in briefs and embrace the failure that can sometimes come with that. The recognition of this being one long process that will never truly end fuels my creativity, knowing that there isn't a \"right answer\" but striving for it anyway and sometimes accepting your shortcomings is a key part of the problem solving process. From a design perspective I find myself most often drawn to vector illustration, as it oozes personality, but have found myself more recently experimenting with more typographic and sometimes photographic solutions as well. I want to learn a multitude of different design processes and styles to have in my toolbox at any given time, like the least useful tradie you've ever met. I hope to work with musicians, sporting clubs and basically any local business owner that needs a leg-up and a helping hand to give a boost to the locals that make this city so great.

I carry my values: drive, passion and empathy, with me through life, but particularly in my approach to design. I utilise these values as my strengths and am always eager to learn more skills. During my studies at Curtin, I had the privilege of being a member and designer of the winning team at the ‘2020 Curtin Creative Jam’. This was a group-challenge with students across multiple areas of design, creating innovative solutions to combat issues surrounding well-being and social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic and I'm currently working on a VR, walk-through experience project soon to be released.

Working for these two companies I understand the importance and place graphic design has in the real world. I am not simply satisfied with creating beautiful composition, rather I strive to communicate something with far more meaning/purpose. Before commencing any design task, I must develop a deep understand of what I am intending to communicate, I do this through thorough research and discussion. My design process is methodical and meticulous, I pay particularly close attention to details such as, hierarchy, balance, scale, colour, aliment, and context to name a few. I find great pleasure in hard work and in learning new skills. I am not afraid to tackle any task thrown my way. Becoming a self-taught DJ that performs in clubs and at festivals to playing professional amateur football in Italy at Juventus Academy, I understand the correlation between hard and succuss in life and that is what separates me from most. Applying this same mentality of work ethic in my design is something that I pride myself and work towards daily.

In my spare time, I hit the arcade for a Dance Dance Revolution session, collect and style clothing, and drink copious amounts of bubble tea and sugar comb iced lattes.","statement":"A graphic designer who brings ideas to life","name":{"preferred":"Erika","first":"Erika","last":"Nguyen"},"majors":[{"id":"Q2JKhMh3LUxZjZRXpTvf","title":"Graphic Design"}],"social":[{"name":"Artstation","link":"https://www.artstation.com/patribalanovsky"},{"name":"Behance","link":"https://www.behance.net/naomigunton"},{"link":"https://nilbertotawata.cgsociety.org/","name":"CGSociety"},{"name":"Dribbble","link":"https://dribbble.com/kylietimpani"},{"name":"Facebook","link":"https://www.facebook.com/Humaan"},{"name":"GitHub","link":"https://github.com/FrancisVillarba"},{"link":"https://www.instagram.com/curtindesign2020/","name":"Instagram"},{"link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-brouse-7890372a/","name":"LinkedIn"},{"name":"Twitter","link":"https://twitter.com/weareanthologie"},{"link":"https://vimeo.com/bphoton","name":"Vimeo"},{"name":"YouTube","link":"https://www.youtube.com/c/ChilledCow"},{"link":"https://bitbucket.org/aj_may/","name":"Bitbucket"},{"link":"https://codepen.io/naomigunton","name":"CodePen"},{"link":"https://polycount.com/profile/discussions/naomiguntonprofile","name":"PolyCount"},{"name":"Tumblr","link":"https://jhnmyr.tumblr.com/"}],"email":"erikanguyen00@outlook.com","projects":[{"alt":"Erika's Project Preview Image 0","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=119i6xf3k8ILZg3TUFEsuTAxXP_Y6GU7s"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b124FeRwbOgpCvfEFllJoUNMhILw5U8W","alt":"Erika's Project Preview Image 1"},{"alt":"Erika's Project Preview Image 2","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1om9hXdTQTmzYAegY21mG5ZnTv2oE0dZQ"},{"alt":"Erika's Project Preview Image 3","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D98_lJUfgD6EKxVoQyotc-XVCkJtl8lY"},{"alt":"Erika's Project Preview Image 4","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FzAHe0_AAECHJj2qca57UCvmXT0Pgzn4"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xJNdw3Lnq-zze8aa-mW9ZGsHcsYNeGTm","alt":"Erika's Project Preview Image 5"}],"profile":"https://www.dbdigitalcreative.com.au/"},{"majors":[{"id":"SY1ApOdJzRd0TmSzkIz5","title":"Creative Advertising"},{"id":"Q2JKhMh3LUxZjZRXpTvf","title":"Graphic Design"}],"statement":"Flexible graphic designer and illustrator ","projects":[{"alt":"Queenie's Project Preview Image 0","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=119i6xf3k8ILZg3TUFEsuTAxXP_Y6GU7s"},{"alt":"Queenie's Project Preview Image 1","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b124FeRwbOgpCvfEFllJoUNMhILw5U8W"},{"alt":"Queenie's Project Preview Image 2","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1om9hXdTQTmzYAegY21mG5ZnTv2oE0dZQ"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D98_lJUfgD6EKxVoQyotc-XVCkJtl8lY","alt":"Queenie's Project Preview Image 3"},{"alt":"Queenie's Project Preview Image 4","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FzAHe0_AAECHJj2qca57UCvmXT0Pgzn4"},{"alt":"Queenie's Project Preview Image 5","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xJNdw3Lnq-zze8aa-mW9ZGsHcsYNeGTm"}],"id":"NKULsWavwE7EOkIb66mB","profile":"https://www.dbdigitalcreative.com.au/","name":{"first":"Queenie","preferred":"","last":"Thum"},"bio":"Coming from a visual arts, illustration and graphic design background, I help brands develop meaningful solutions beyond pretty pictures.

Also a self-proclaimed egg, tea and noodle dish enthusiast.","social":[{"link":"https://www.artstation.com/patribalanovsky","name":"Artstation"},{"link":"https://www.behance.net/naomigunton","name":"Behance"},{"name":"CGSociety","link":"https://nilbertotawata.cgsociety.org/"},{"link":"https://dribbble.com/kylietimpani","name":"Dribbble"},{"link":"https://www.facebook.com/Humaan","name":"Facebook"},{"name":"GitHub","link":"https://github.com/FrancisVillarba"},{"name":"Instagram","link":"https://www.instagram.com/curtindesign2020/"},{"name":"LinkedIn","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-brouse-7890372a/"},{"name":"Twitter","link":"https://twitter.com/weareanthologie"},{"link":"https://vimeo.com/bphoton","name":"Vimeo"},{"name":"YouTube","link":"https://www.youtube.com/c/ChilledCow"},{"name":"Bitbucket","link":"https://bitbucket.org/aj_may/"},{"link":"https://codepen.io/naomigunton","name":"CodePen"},{"name":"PolyCount","link":"https://polycount.com/profile/discussions/naomiguntonprofile"},{"name":"Tumblr","link":"https://jhnmyr.tumblr.com/"}],"email":"christabel10@yahoo.com.au","name":{"first":"Angeline","preferred":"","last":"Nguyen"},"projects":[{"alt":"Angeline's Project Preview Image 0","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=119i6xf3k8ILZg3TUFEsuTAxXP_Y6GU7s"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b124FeRwbOgpCvfEFllJoUNMhILw5U8W","alt":"Angeline's Project Preview Image 1"},{"alt":"Angeline's Project Preview Image 2","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1om9hXdTQTmzYAegY21mG5ZnTv2oE0dZQ"},{"alt":"Angeline's Project Preview Image 3","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D98_lJUfgD6EKxVoQyotc-XVCkJtl8lY"},{"alt":"Angeline's Project Preview Image 4","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FzAHe0_AAECHJj2qca57UCvmXT0Pgzn4"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xJNdw3Lnq-zze8aa-mW9ZGsHcsYNeGTm","alt":"Angeline's Project Preview Image 5"}],"statement":"An Illustrator, who's brain is a traffic of Graphics","id":"TmjP87uNYuevD1jNKETy","majors":[{"id":"HMc6Bn6bu79CwRPUaeI6","title":"Animation & Game Design"}]},{"social":[{"link":"https://www.artstation.com/patribalanovsky","name":"Artstation"},{"name":"Behance","link":"https://www.behance.net/naomigunton"},{"name":"CGSociety","link":"https://nilbertotawata.cgsociety.org/"},{"name":"Dribbble","link":"https://dribbble.com/kylietimpani"},{"name":"Facebook","link":"https://www.facebook.com/Humaan"},{"name":"GitHub","link":"https://github.com/FrancisVillarba"},{"name":"Instagram","link":"https://www.instagram.com/curtindesign2020/"},{"link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-brouse-7890372a/","name":"LinkedIn"},{"link":"https://twitter.com/weareanthologie","name":"Twitter"},{"link":"https://vimeo.com/bphoton","name":"Vimeo"},{"name":"YouTube","link":"https://www.youtube.com/c/ChilledCow"},{"link":"https://bitbucket.org/aj_may/","name":"Bitbucket"},{"link":"https://codepen.io/naomigunton","name":"CodePen"},{"name":"PolyCount","link":"https://polycount.com/profile/discussions/naomiguntonprofile"},{"name":"Tumblr","link":"https://jhnmyr.tumblr.com/"}],"email":"charmaine.rebekah@gmail.com","profile":"https://www.dbdigitalcreative.com.au/","statement":"Graphic designer with a love for type, coffee and silly things","majors":[{"id":"Q2JKhMh3LUxZjZRXpTvf","title":"Graphic Design"}],"projects":[{"alt":"Charmaine's Project Preview Image 0","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=119i6xf3k8ILZg3TUFEsuTAxXP_Y6GU7s"},{"alt":"Charmaine's Project Preview Image 1","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b124FeRwbOgpCvfEFllJoUNMhILw5U8W"},{"alt":"Charmaine's Project Preview Image 2","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1om9hXdTQTmzYAegY21mG5ZnTv2oE0dZQ"},{"alt":"Charmaine's Project Preview Image 3","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D98_lJUfgD6EKxVoQyotc-XVCkJtl8lY"},{"alt":"Charmaine's Project Preview Image 4","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FzAHe0_AAECHJj2qca57UCvmXT0Pgzn4"},{"alt":"Charmaine's Project Preview Image 5","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xJNdw3Lnq-zze8aa-mW9ZGsHcsYNeGTm"}],"name":{"preferred":"Charmaine","last":"Koh","first":"Charmaine"},"bio":"Love for great design, check.

Three years ago, if you had of told me that I would find a home in designing websites and mobile applications, I would’ve laughed it off. But wow, here we are, and I couldn’t be happier!

After settling into digital design, I’ve strived to learn the necessary skills of design that were initially so foreign to me. Most importantly I’ve loved every second of it!

My philosophy on animation is about leaving your mark on a frame, your personal touch that contributes to a project greater than the sum of its parts. When I animate, I sit down, I get the tablet out, I stretch, then I take out a muesli bar. Hydration is important too. These animation habits are essential life-changing practises that I have learnt from my studies at Curtin University. You know, when people ask me, 'Winston, why are you doing this?' I smile, and I say, 'Why do birds not chirp at night?' They look back, confused, because they obviously hadn't had their 9 hours of sleep, another essential animation skill I've adopted into my tight schedule. I also believe that if you don't enjoy what you love, you may very well shrivel up and cry in anguish like those seals. I've never cried, and I have my peers and tutors at Curtin to thank them for it.

This would fuel my inner desire to impart one of the great works of film, television or games that have so immensely moulded me.","majors":[{"id":"HMc6Bn6bu79CwRPUaeI6","title":"Animation & Game Design"},{"id":"K77VrZratwDXnVAaeF4c","title":"Illustration"}],"email":"19142043@student.curtin.edu.au","id":"f1HkYjcLFIdyHINugZ7V","statement":"Animation makes it easy to believe that poetry and physics are the same thing, making motion and art rhyme","name":{"first":"Dung","last":"Nguyen","preferred":"Dung"},"projects":[{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=119i6xf3k8ILZg3TUFEsuTAxXP_Y6GU7s","alt":"Dung's Project Preview Image 0"},{"alt":"Dung's Project Preview Image 1","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b124FeRwbOgpCvfEFllJoUNMhILw5U8W"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1om9hXdTQTmzYAegY21mG5ZnTv2oE0dZQ","alt":"Dung's Project Preview Image 2"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D98_lJUfgD6EKxVoQyotc-XVCkJtl8lY","alt":"Dung's Project Preview Image 3"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FzAHe0_AAECHJj2qca57UCvmXT0Pgzn4","alt":"Dung's Project Preview Image 4"},{"alt":"Dung's Project Preview Image 5","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xJNdw3Lnq-zze8aa-mW9ZGsHcsYNeGTm"}],"social":[{"name":"Artstation","link":"https://www.artstation.com/patribalanovsky"},{"name":"Behance","link":"https://www.behance.net/naomigunton"},{"name":"CGSociety","link":"https://nilbertotawata.cgsociety.org/"},{"name":"Dribbble","link":"https://dribbble.com/kylietimpani"},{"name":"Facebook","link":"https://www.facebook.com/Humaan"},{"name":"GitHub","link":"https://github.com/FrancisVillarba"},{"link":"https://www.instagram.com/curtindesign2020/","name":"Instagram"},{"link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-brouse-7890372a/","name":"LinkedIn"},{"name":"Twitter","link":"https://twitter.com/weareanthologie"},{"name":"Vimeo","link":"https://vimeo.com/bphoton"},{"link":"https://www.youtube.com/c/ChilledCow","name":"YouTube"},{"name":"Bitbucket","link":"https://bitbucket.org/aj_may/"},{"name":"CodePen","link":"https://codepen.io/naomigunton"},{"link":"https://polycount.com/profile/discussions/naomiguntonprofile","name":"PolyCount"},{"name":"Tumblr","link":"https://jhnmyr.tumblr.com/"}],"profile":"https://www.dbdigitalcreative.com.au/"},{"projects":[{"alt":"James's Project Preview Image 0","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=119i6xf3k8ILZg3TUFEsuTAxXP_Y6GU7s"},{"alt":"James's Project Preview Image 1","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b124FeRwbOgpCvfEFllJoUNMhILw5U8W"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1om9hXdTQTmzYAegY21mG5ZnTv2oE0dZQ","alt":"James's Project Preview Image 2"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D98_lJUfgD6EKxVoQyotc-XVCkJtl8lY","alt":"James's Project Preview Image 3"},{"alt":"James's Project Preview Image 4","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FzAHe0_AAECHJj2qca57UCvmXT0Pgzn4"},{"alt":"James's Project Preview Image 5","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xJNdw3Lnq-zze8aa-mW9ZGsHcsYNeGTm"}],"social":[{"name":"Artstation","link":"https://www.artstation.com/patribalanovsky"},{"link":"https://www.behance.net/naomigunton","name":"Behance"},{"link":"https://nilbertotawata.cgsociety.org/","name":"CGSociety"},{"link":"https://dribbble.com/kylietimpani","name":"Dribbble"},{"link":"https://www.facebook.com/Humaan","name":"Facebook"},{"link":"https://github.com/FrancisVillarba","name":"GitHub"},{"name":"Instagram","link":"https://www.instagram.com/curtindesign2020/"},{"link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-brouse-7890372a/","name":"LinkedIn"},{"link":"https://twitter.com/weareanthologie","name":"Twitter"},{"link":"https://vimeo.com/bphoton","name":"Vimeo"},{"name":"YouTube","link":"https://www.youtube.com/c/ChilledCow"},{"name":"Bitbucket","link":"https://bitbucket.org/aj_may/"},{"link":"https://codepen.io/naomigunton","name":"CodePen"},{"name":"PolyCount","link":"https://polycount.com/profile/discussions/naomiguntonprofile"},{"name":"Tumblr","link":"https://jhnmyr.tumblr.com/"}],"bio":"I am an aspiring web designer and full-stack developer who loves watching designs come to life.

I come from the middle of nowhere.\n\nI have a crippling passion for creating illustrations and animations, 2D, 3D, I don't care how many D's, if it's an animation or illustration, i'm there! In illustration my interests are concept art (environment and character), with strengths in mediums ranging from traditional pencil sketching to fully blended digital painting. In Animation my strengths are motion graphics, 3D animations, and traditional 2D animation. There is no greater satisfaction in life than creating a smooth, well paced animation from storyboard to finish. Other neat skills i keep up my sleeve include 3D level design, 3D asset modelling, music score composition, sound design & production.\n\nI'm shooting for the top in my career! That means giving it my all every step of the way, so that I can become a successful concept artist with the means to realise my characters and environments through animation and game design. Aiming to for the top means I have to stay in peak physical and mental condition, so I spend my spare time working out and looking after my body.

I have learned so much during my time at Curtin, and it’s been exciting to see my research, ideation and technical skills develop over time. Despite that, I’m still always looking for new things to learn, new approaches to design tasks, and new perspectives to consider. This year I was lucky enough to be chosen to create the brand identity for the 2020 design graduate exhibition - Disruption. It has been an amazing project to work on, and getting the chance to collaborate with people across the design disciplines has been a great opportunity to learn how to work with a huge team of creative minded people.

But I didn’t take the midnight train going anywhere, because A, there are none of those in Kulin, and B, that sounds like a bad idea. \n\nHi, I’m Cush. I am so very close to graduating with a degree in Creative Advertising and Graphic Design, and I could not be more excited. With a passion for copywriting and bright colours, I am stumbling through life making my housemates watch ads on TV for fun while drinking coffee and wine. \n\nI have always worked hard and appreciated people who dared to dream. I grew up in a tiny town with supportive parents who taught me if you want something, you work your ass off to get there. I am a passionate and empathetic person with a creative mind that wanders constantly, and this helped me get to where I am today. \n\nA lesson I will share with you is that you shouldn’t let people judge you for chasing what you want. This was learned when I was a child and my mother let me buy a potato from the IGA with my weekly pocket money. Don’t let anyone crush your dreams kid. \n"},{"social":[{"name":"Artstation","link":"https://www.artstation.com/patribalanovsky"},{"link":"https://www.behance.net/naomigunton","name":"Behance"},{"name":"CGSociety","link":"https://nilbertotawata.cgsociety.org/"},{"link":"https://dribbble.com/kylietimpani","name":"Dribbble"},{"link":"https://www.facebook.com/Humaan","name":"Facebook"},{"name":"GitHub","link":"https://github.com/FrancisVillarba"},{"name":"Instagram","link":"https://www.instagram.com/curtindesign2020/"},{"name":"LinkedIn","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-brouse-7890372a/"},{"name":"Twitter","link":"https://twitter.com/weareanthologie"},{"link":"https://vimeo.com/bphoton","name":"Vimeo"},{"name":"YouTube","link":"https://www.youtube.com/c/ChilledCow"},{"name":"Bitbucket","link":"https://bitbucket.org/aj_may/"},{"name":"CodePen","link":"https://codepen.io/naomigunton"},{"link":"https://polycount.com/profile/discussions/naomiguntonprofile","name":"PolyCount"},{"name":"Tumblr","link":"https://jhnmyr.tumblr.com/"}],"statement":"Fresh design & modern marketing","profile":"https://www.dbdigitalcreative.com.au/","majors":[{"id":"SY1ApOdJzRd0TmSzkIz5","title":"Creative Advertising"},{"id":"Q2JKhMh3LUxZjZRXpTvf","title":"Graphic Design"}],"projects":[{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=119i6xf3k8ILZg3TUFEsuTAxXP_Y6GU7s","alt":"Sophia's Project Preview Image 0"},{"alt":"Sophia's Project Preview Image 1","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b124FeRwbOgpCvfEFllJoUNMhILw5U8W"},{"alt":"Sophia's Project Preview Image 2","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1om9hXdTQTmzYAegY21mG5ZnTv2oE0dZQ"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D98_lJUfgD6EKxVoQyotc-XVCkJtl8lY","alt":"Sophia's Project Preview Image 3"},{"alt":"Sophia's Project Preview Image 4","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FzAHe0_AAECHJj2qca57UCvmXT0Pgzn4"},{"alt":"Sophia's Project Preview Image 5","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xJNdw3Lnq-zze8aa-mW9ZGsHcsYNeGTm"}],"name":{"preferred":"","last":"Tran","first":"Sophia"},"bio":"I am a person that loves to creative problem solve.

Outside of my classes I have completed a marketing and communications internship at Curtin’s FBL Student Engagement team, been part of the High Achievers program and am currently working part time as a social media assistant at the marketing agency, Simtail.

","bio":"I am passionate about creating human-centered branding and packaging solutions that are influenced by human perspective in every step of the process. I aim to produce strategy through solutions tailored to suit every brand and their customers, and with my attention to detail, I make sure no icon is misaligned. I’m driven to work with brands with a purpose beyond making a profit – whether that be helping the environment or supporting a local charity. I like to be challenged, and am motivated to always be learning and growing my skillset so as to never settle for average. Through my time at university, I have found I work best collaboratively, and so have started a small design business with my friend, which we aim to take into freelance and agency work. I aspire to always produce work that helps those with big dreams be one step closer to achieving their goals, and to bring a smile and spark of inspiration to every client I meet. In my spare time, I’m often caught with a Netflix show playing, and a cup of tea in my hand.","projects":[{"alt":"Charlotte's Project Preview Image 0","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=119i6xf3k8ILZg3TUFEsuTAxXP_Y6GU7s"},{"alt":"Charlotte's Project Preview Image 1","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b124FeRwbOgpCvfEFllJoUNMhILw5U8W"},{"alt":"Charlotte's Project Preview Image 2","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1om9hXdTQTmzYAegY21mG5ZnTv2oE0dZQ"},{"alt":"Charlotte's Project Preview Image 3","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D98_lJUfgD6EKxVoQyotc-XVCkJtl8lY"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FzAHe0_AAECHJj2qca57UCvmXT0Pgzn4","alt":"Charlotte's Project Preview Image 4"},{"alt":"Charlotte's Project Preview Image 5","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xJNdw3Lnq-zze8aa-mW9ZGsHcsYNeGTm"}],"id":"yWvIxcmigBJW40hddYGG","social":[{"link":"https://www.artstation.com/patribalanovsky","name":"Artstation"},{"name":"Behance","link":"https://www.behance.net/naomigunton"},{"link":"https://nilbertotawata.cgsociety.org/","name":"CGSociety"},{"name":"Dribbble","link":"https://dribbble.com/kylietimpani"},{"link":"https://www.facebook.com/Humaan","name":"Facebook"},{"name":"GitHub","link":"https://github.com/FrancisVillarba"},{"name":"Instagram","link":"https://www.instagram.com/curtindesign2020/"},{"name":"LinkedIn","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-brouse-7890372a/"},{"link":"https://twitter.com/weareanthologie","name":"Twitter"},{"link":"https://vimeo.com/bphoton","name":"Vimeo"},{"link":"https://www.youtube.com/c/ChilledCow","name":"YouTube"},{"name":"Bitbucket","link":"https://bitbucket.org/aj_may/"},{"name":"CodePen","link":"https://codepen.io/naomigunton"},{"name":"PolyCount","link":"https://polycount.com/profile/discussions/naomiguntonprofile"},{"name":"Tumblr","link":"https://jhnmyr.tumblr.com/"}],"name":{"last":"Batt","first":"Charlotte","preferred":""},"majors":[{"id":"Q2JKhMh3LUxZjZRXpTvf","title":"Graphic Design"}],"profile":"https://www.dbdigitalcreative.com.au/","email":"charlottehollydesigns@gmail.com"},{"social":[{"link":"https://www.artstation.com/patribalanovsky","name":"Artstation"},{"link":"https://www.behance.net/naomigunton","name":"Behance"},{"name":"CGSociety","link":"https://nilbertotawata.cgsociety.org/"},{"name":"Dribbble","link":"https://dribbble.com/kylietimpani"},{"name":"Facebook","link":"https://www.facebook.com/Humaan"},{"name":"GitHub","link":"https://github.com/FrancisVillarba"},{"name":"Instagram","link":"https://www.instagram.com/curtindesign2020/"},{"link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-brouse-7890372a/","name":"LinkedIn"},{"name":"Twitter","link":"https://twitter.com/weareanthologie"},{"link":"https://vimeo.com/bphoton","name":"Vimeo"},{"name":"YouTube","link":"https://www.youtube.com/c/ChilledCow"},{"name":"Bitbucket","link":"https://bitbucket.org/aj_may/"},{"link":"https://codepen.io/naomigunton","name":"CodePen"},{"link":"https://polycount.com/profile/discussions/naomiguntonprofile","name":"PolyCount"},{"name":"Tumblr","link":"https://jhnmyr.tumblr.com/"}],"projects":[{"alt":"Anjela's Project Preview Image 0","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=119i6xf3k8ILZg3TUFEsuTAxXP_Y6GU7s"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b124FeRwbOgpCvfEFllJoUNMhILw5U8W","alt":"Anjela's Project Preview Image 1"},{"alt":"Anjela's Project Preview Image 2","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1om9hXdTQTmzYAegY21mG5ZnTv2oE0dZQ"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D98_lJUfgD6EKxVoQyotc-XVCkJtl8lY","alt":"Anjela's Project Preview Image 3"},{"alt":"Anjela's Project Preview Image 4","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FzAHe0_AAECHJj2qca57UCvmXT0Pgzn4"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xJNdw3Lnq-zze8aa-mW9ZGsHcsYNeGTm","alt":"Anjela's Project Preview Image 5"}],"email":"sweettangerine.creative@gmail.com","name":{"preferred":"Anjie","first":"Anjela","last":"Hughes"},"id":"yXf2ByOfTNIYUKFoEEfU","profile":"https://www.dbdigitalcreative.com.au/","bio":"I am a passionate creative with a drive to produce high quality design solutions.
