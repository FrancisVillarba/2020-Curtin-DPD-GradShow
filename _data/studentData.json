I come from the middle of nowhere.\n\nI have a crippling passion for creating illustrations and animations, 2D, 3D, I don't care how many D's, if it's an animation or illustration, i'm there! In illustration my interests are concept art (environment and character), with strengths in mediums ranging from traditional pencil sketching to fully blended digital painting. In Animation my strengths are motion graphics, 3D animations, and traditional 2D animation. There is no greater satisfaction in life than creating a smooth, well paced animation from storyboard to finish. Other neat skills i keep up my sleeve include 3D level design, 3D asset modelling, music score composition, sound design & production.\n\nI'm shooting for the top in my career! That means giving it my all every step of the way, so that I can become a successful concept artist with the means to realise my characters and environments through animation and game design. Aiming to for the top means I have to stay in peak physical and mental condition, so I spend my spare time working out and looking after my body. My other interests include playing a variety of instruments (drums, guitar, piano, accordion), watching animated films, video games & building plastic models.","statement":"Drawing fridge worthy pictures & making them move","social":[{"link":"https://www.artstation.com/harrisonfellows/profile","name":"Artstation"},{"name":"Instagram","link":"https://www.instagram.com/haz_animation/?hl=en"},{"name":"LinkedIn","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrison-fellows-60a5791b5/"}],"majors":[{"id":"HMc6Bn6bu79CwRPUaeI6","title":"Animation & Game Design"}],"id":"0E7Yckye9SRpeAUAbUqx","portfolio":"https://www.harrisonfellows.com","name":{"preferred":"Harry","first":"Harrison","last":"Fellows"}},{"email":"celovilches@gmail.com","majors":[{"id":"Wvll0Lz78WqyUWpZ6qmD","title":"Digital Design"}],"statement":"Creator at heart, Designer by nature","name":{"first":"Marcelo","last":"Jopia Vilches","preferred":"Marcelo Vilches"},"bio":"My past has seen me pursue an array of disciplines, but I have finally found my 'home' in digital design.

Throughout the years of studying Graphic Design at Curtin, it has challenged me in many ways that I can proudly say that I have what it takes to be a Graphic Designer. Creative thinking is often part of the process and what’s great about graphic design is that you can turn your imaginations into creations. In my spare time, I’m a makeup artist and boba addict (I love boba to the point that I created a book called “The Secrets to Boba” in Publication Design).","name":{"last":"Soon","preferred":"Tian","first":"Tian"},"id":"D10xqFBhtrbvNbTLpoEF","majors":[{"id":"wv8b6Q5MsnqrMmtEmXPE","title":"Creative Advertising & Graphic Design"}]},{"name":{"last":"Williamson","first":"James","preferred":"James"},"majors":[{"id":"HMc6Bn6bu79CwRPUaeI6","title":"Animation & Game Design"}],"email":"jamesjam86@gmail.com","statement":"I create 3D models and stuff","id":"Dd0iEjphbkiN4ShaL50L","bio":"“Since the beginning of time, man has yearned to destroy the sun”, and as a 3D artist I can.

After graduating I landed a job in the signage industry and have grown a wide knowledge of skills I will use throughout my career. My desire to learn more and enhance my skills lead my mind to university. Curtin has taught me design strategy and how to push my designs to the next level. I am a perfectionist and take pride in my attention to detail, being a tidsoptimist, thinking I have more time than I do. I have the ability to work effectively and strive in a challenging professional environment. Branding and signage can be considered as my strengths and I am very motivated to build my skills in packaging, calligraphy/type design and illustration.

I have a passion for creating innovative brand rollouts that’re supported by visual research, appropriate design strategy, a fluent process of valid ideation and of course, final refinements based off feedback from some washed up design teachers. All jokes aside, throughout this past year I have felt immersed into the world of design. From seeing poor typesetting on the side of a building to reading an old book that contains a brandmark from 30 years ago but still works today, is essentially what design is all about. Observing creative mediums that are often overlooked by the public majority. That’s why I’ve chosen this path and I’ve decided to commit to it all the way.
