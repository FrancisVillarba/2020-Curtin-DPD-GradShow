Working for these two companies I understand the importance and place graphic design has in the real world. I am not simply satisfied with creating beautiful composition, rather I strive to communicate something with far more meaning/purpose. Before commencing any design task, I must develop a deep understand of what I am intending to communicate, I do this through thorough research and discussion. My design process is methodical and meticulous, I pay particularly close attention to details such as, hierarchy, balance, scale, colour, aliment, and context to name a few. I find great pleasure in hard work and in learning new skills. I am not afraid to tackle any task thrown my way. Becoming a self-taught DJ that performs in clubs and at festivals to playing professional amateur football in Italy at Juventus Academy, I understand the correlation between hard and success in life and that is what separates me from most.

In illustration my interests are concept art (environment and character), with strengths in mediums ranging from traditional pencil sketching to fully blended digital painting. In Animation my strengths are motion graphics, 3D animations, and traditional 2D animation. There is no greater satisfaction in life than creating a smooth, well paced animation from storyboard to finish. Other neat skills i keep up my sleeve include 3D level design, 3D asset modelling, music score composition, sound design & production.\n\nI'm shooting for the top in my career! That means giving it my all every step of the way, so that I can become a successful concept artist with the means to realise my characters and environments through animation and game design. Aiming to for the top means I have to stay in peak physical and mental condition, so I spend my spare time working out and looking after my body.

I’ve been studying graphic design for 5 years now, and have developed a keen passion for branding and packaging.

This year I was lucky enough to be chosen to create the brand identity for the 2020 design graduate exhibition - Disruption. It has been an amazing project to work on, and getting the chance to collaborate with people across the design disciplines has been a great opportunity to learn how to work with a huge team of creative minded people.

When I animate, I sit down, I get the tablet out, I stretch, then I take out a muesli bar. Hydration is important too. These animation habits are essential life-changing practises that I have learnt from my studies at Curtin University. You know, when people ask me, 'Winston, why are you doing this?' I smile, and I say, 'Why do birds not chirp at night?' They look back, confused, because they obviously hadn't had their 9 hours of sleep, another essential animation skill I've adopted into my tight schedule. I also believe that if you don't enjoy what you love, you may very well shrivel up and cry in anguish like those seals.

I consider myself to have excellent attention to detail and believe even the smaller details such as kerning can make as big of an impact as large illustrations. Typography and publication design are two of my strengths with food photography being one of my passions as I love to cook and create in the kitchen. I am an extremely creative person in all aspects of my life, and my passion for design comes from the pride and accomplishment you get when you see someone’s, or your own vision come to life. My aspiration is to work alongside brands and other creatives to produce work that not only tell a story but prove effective in solving one’s design problem.

Curtin has taught me not to take myself too seriously, to push my ideas as far as possible, to think outside the square and that no idea should be disregarded (sometimes the best best cookies are found at the bottom of the jar). With determination, commitment and perseverance I hope to continue to push myself creatively, and to one day be a part of an innovative team/agency that helps me to reach my full potential and represent myself as an impactful creative advertiser.
