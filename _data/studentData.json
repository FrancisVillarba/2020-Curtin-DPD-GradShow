I find that whenever I think I have completed a project, there’s always something more I could do, more flair I could add, more ways to elevate my work and knowledge as a designer and these additional touches are usually little more than a tutorial away. Because of this, I find that I am never doing the same thing constantly and I am always learning, which feels fresh and invigorating and motivates me to expand my skillsets and pursue success in this industry, even when feeling overwhelmed or constrained by other responsibilities.
