[{"bio":"At Curtin, I have been able to start finding my voice in design! Currently, I am most interested in designing for the food and beverage industry, focusing on branding and packaging designs that are fun and different. \n\nThroughout my degree, I have been able to delve into more of my creative interests through undertaking illustration, photography, and animation and game design elective units. I have also been extremely lucky to have been able to undertake an online internship at Tokyo Weekender, improving my typographic and editorial knowledge. \n\nWhen I’m not designing food and beverage things, you will find me consuming food and beverage things (especially bubble tea <3).

I’m known round these parts as a bit of an eshay lad type character, but at Curtin I tend to tone it down a bit. I’m an inspiring and motivated graphic designer, that is committed to the craft of creating effective design solutions for the grim looking future. I like to be honest with my approach, and I expect the same back from my peers and potential co-workers or employees. I have a passion for creating innovative brand rollouts that’re supported by visual research, appropriate design strategy, a fluent process of valid ideation and of course, final refinements based off feedback from some washed up design teachers. All jokes aside, throughout this past year I have felt immersed into the world of design. From seeing poor typesetting on the side of a building to reading an old book that contains a brandmark from 30 years ago but still works today, is essentially what design is all about. Observing creative mediums that are often overlooked by the public majority. That’s why I’ve chosen this path and I’ve decided to commit to it all the way.

In my spare time, I’m a makeup artist and boba addict (I love boba to the point that I created a book called “The Secrets to Boba” in Publication Design).","email":"tian_soon98@hotmail.com","name":{"first":"Tian","last":"Soon","preferred":"Tian"},"majors":[{"id":"Q2JKhMh3LUxZjZRXpTvf","title":"Graphic Design"}],"id":"BYjyWou4rPfQzRlUo8ON","projects":[{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=119i6xf3k8ILZg3TUFEsuTAxXP_Y6GU7s","alt":"Tian's Project Preview Image 0"},{"alt":"Tian's Project Preview Image 1","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b124FeRwbOgpCvfEFllJoUNMhILw5U8W"},{"alt":"Tian's Project Preview Image 2","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1om9hXdTQTmzYAegY21mG5ZnTv2oE0dZQ"},{"alt":"Tian's Project Preview Image 3","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D98_lJUfgD6EKxVoQyotc-XVCkJtl8lY"},{"alt":"Tian's Project Preview Image 4","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FzAHe0_AAECHJj2qca57UCvmXT0Pgzn4"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xJNdw3Lnq-zze8aa-mW9ZGsHcsYNeGTm","alt":"Tian's Project Preview Image 5"}],"profile":"https://www.dbdigitalcreative.com.au/","social":["https://www.artstation.com/patribalanovsky","https://www.behance.net/naomigunton","https://nilbertotawata.cgsociety.org/","https://dribbble.com/kylietimpani","https://www.facebook.com/Humaan","https://github.com/FrancisVillarba","https://www.instagram.com/curtindesign2020/","https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-brouse-7890372a/","https://twitter.com/weareanthologie","https://vimeo.com/bphoton","https://www.youtube.com/c/ChilledCow","https://bitbucket.org/aj_may/","https://codepen.io/naomigunton","https://polycount.com/profile/discussions/naomiguntonprofile","https://jhnmyr.tumblr.com/"]},{"social":["https://www.artstation.com/patribalanovsky","https://www.behance.net/naomigunton","https://nilbertotawata.cgsociety.org/","https://dribbble.com/kylietimpani","https://www.facebook.com/Humaan","https://github.com/FrancisVillarba","https://www.instagram.com/curtindesign2020/","https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-brouse-7890372a/","https://twitter.com/weareanthologie","https://vimeo.com/bphoton","https://www.youtube.com/c/ChilledCow","https://bitbucket.org/aj_may/","https://codepen.io/naomigunton","https://polycount.com/profile/discussions/naomiguntonprofile","https://jhnmyr.tumblr.com/"],"id":"BifxcKrNnYLs65Nzc9b2","bio":"Howdy I'm a Graphic Design and Illustration student. I currently run the Curtin Illustration Club as the 2020 president as well as helping out with Curtin Life Drawing. With the CIC my goal is to help foster a sense of community for the students, as well as providing free life drawing as a foundation of art. Due to my double major in graphic design and illustration, I'm able to combine these skill sets to save time and money. While studying I've also had the opportunity to work with Studio Papa, where I collaborate with their art direction to bring to life some illustrations for a few beer labels for Nowhereman Brewing. During my final semester, I've also had the chance to intern at Accumulate, where I was tasked with creating new designs and updating their website. But in my spare time, my absolute favourite thing to do is draw fantasy art.

When I’m not working on a project site, I enjoy working on my project car, collecting records, taking photos and defending my ‘top-100’ ranking in Garfield Kart.

I hope I can be hired to work in the design industry so I can put everything I have learnt so far into practice. Outside of university, I am a workaholic. I work full days in a post office on Monday and Tuesday. Volunteer at an animal shelter on Wednesday. Attend uni on Thursday and Friday. Participate in orchestra every Sunday to practice for performances and teach. I also play badminton twice a week. Giving myself a lot of things to do help me grow in more than one direction.

Working for these two companies I understand the importance and place graphic design has in the real world. I am not simply satisfied with creating beautiful composition, rather I strive to communicate something with far more meaning/purpose. Before commencing any design task, I must develop a deep understand of what I am intending to communicate, I do this through thorough research and discussion. My design process is methodical and meticulous, I pay particularly close attention to details such as, hierarchy, balance, scale, colour, aliment, and context to name a few. I find great pleasure in hard work and in learning new skills. I am not afraid to tackle any task thrown my way. Becoming a self-taught DJ that performs in clubs and at festivals to playing professional amateur football in Italy at Juventus Academy, I understand the correlation between hard and succuss in life and that is what separates me from most. Applying this same mentality of work ethic in my design is something that I pride myself and work towards daily.

I’ve worked hard to gain experiences that include visual merchandising, shoe design, fashion design, sculpture, illustration and graphic design.

Branding and packaging design are things I enjoy the most and would like to specialise in those areas. When I'm out and about, I'm always analysing brands and everyday products to see what I like and would improve on. Whilst studying, I completed an online internship with Tokyo Weekender over a semester. I was assigned briefs to be completed by deadlines. Tasks ranged from publication, logo development, social media graphics, banners and posters. I'm willing to take on any aspect of a job and will always give it my best. In my spare time, I like working on cars and motorbikes. I enjoy finding and fixing problems either on my own or with the help of my friends.

My interests in design started at a young age when I would fill sketchbooks with all kinds of drawings and constantly strived to be a better artist and illustrator with strong attention to detail. This creativity and attention to detail slowly evolved into a general passion for art and design, which I finally decided to try and do something with when I realised that even if I were to fail, that you only get one life and you should strive to do what you love if you’re given the privilege to try. In my spare time I enjoy taking day long hikes with my cheap camera to play around with, happily snapping away at everything I see, as well as the usual dorky stuff like tabletop gaming, board games, video games, EDM and metal music, and consuming every bit of good fantasy and sci-fi related media that I can get my grubby little hands on.

I’m Dave, an aspiring Motion Graphics and Visual Effects Artist. I am constantly motivated to deliver high quality designs with a focus on minimalism, satisfying composition and smooth animations! What I love about animation and the design industry in general, is the wealth of knowledge on offer and that you can always learn new skills. I find that whenever I think I have completed a project, there’s always something more I could do, more flair I could add, more ways to elevate my work and knowledge as a designer and these additional touches are usually little more than a tutorial away. Because of this, I find that I am never doing the same thing constantly and I am always learning, which feels fresh and invigorating and motivates me to expand my skillsets and pursue success in this industry, even when feeling overwhelmed or constrained by other responsibilities. I have excellent attention to detail, obsessing over every pixel of every frame and will put genuine thought into creating a meaningful design solution for anyone in need! My aspiration is to develop Motion Graphics and Visual Effects for film and television whilst additionally assisting with other areas of Postproduction.

These animation habits are essential life-changing practises that I have learnt from my studies at Curtin University. You know, when people ask me, 'Winston, why are you doing this?' I smile, and I say, 'Why do birds not chirp at night?' They look back, confused, because they obviously hadn't had their 9 hours of sleep, another essential animation skill I've adopted into my tight schedule.

I am so very close to graduating with a degree in Creative Advertising and Graphic Design, and I could not be more excited. With a passion for copywriting and bright colours, I am stumbling through life making my housemates watch ads on TV for fun while drinking coffee and wine. \n\nI have always worked hard and appreciated people who dared to dream.

I am a passionate and empathetic person with a creative mind that wanders constantly, and this helped me get to where I am today. \n\nA lesson I will share with you is that you shouldn’t let people judge you for chasing what you want.

I come from the middle of nowhere.\n\nI have a crippling passion for creating illustrations and animations, 2D, 3D, I don't care how many D's, if it's an animation or illustration, i'm there! In illustration my interests are concept art (environment and character), with strengths in mediums ranging from traditional pencil sketching to fully blended digital painting. In Animation my strengths are motion graphics, 3D animations, and traditional 2D animation. There is no greater satisfaction in life than creating a smooth, well paced animation from storyboard to finish. Other neat skills i keep up my sleeve include 3D level design, 3D asset modelling, music score composition, sound design & production.\n\nI'm shooting for the top in my career! That means giving it my all every step of the way, so that I can become a successful concept artist with the means to realise my characters and environments through animation and game design. Aiming to for the top means I have to stay in peak physical and mental condition, so I spend my spare time working out and looking after my body. My other interests include playing a variety of instruments (drums, guitar, piano, accordion), watching animated films, video games & building plastic models.","statement":"Drawing fridge worthy pictures & making them move","name":{"first":"Harrison","preferred":"Harry","last":"Fellows"},"id":"u6i6GoCmTbQrkoXW6rFt","majors":[{"id":"HMc6Bn6bu79CwRPUaeI6","title":"Animation & Game Design"}],"social":["https://www.artstation.com/patribalanovsky","https://www.behance.net/naomigunton","https://nilbertotawata.cgsociety.org/","https://dribbble.com/kylietimpani","https://www.facebook.com/Humaan","https://github.com/FrancisVillarba","https://www.instagram.com/curtindesign2020/","https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-brouse-7890372a/","https://twitter.com/weareanthologie","https://vimeo.com/bphoton","https://www.youtube.com/c/ChilledCow","https://bitbucket.org/aj_may/","https://codepen.io/naomigunton","https://polycount.com/profile/discussions/naomiguntonprofile","https://jhnmyr.tumblr.com/"],"email":"harrison.fellows1@gmail.com","projects":[{"alt":"Harrison's Project Preview Image 0","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=119i6xf3k8ILZg3TUFEsuTAxXP_Y6GU7s"},{"alt":"Harrison's Project Preview Image 1","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b124FeRwbOgpCvfEFllJoUNMhILw5U8W"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1om9hXdTQTmzYAegY21mG5ZnTv2oE0dZQ","alt":"Harrison's Project Preview Image 2"},{"alt":"Harrison's Project Preview Image 3","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D98_lJUfgD6EKxVoQyotc-XVCkJtl8lY"},{"src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FzAHe0_AAECHJj2qca57UCvmXT0Pgzn4","alt":"Harrison's Project Preview Image 4"},{"alt":"Harrison's Project Preview Image 5","src":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xJNdw3Lnq-zze8aa-mW9ZGsHcsYNeGTm"}]},{"profile":"https://www.dbdigitalcreative.com.au/","social":["https://www.artstation.com/patribalanovsky","https://www.behance.net/naomigunton","https://nilbertotawata.cgsociety.org/","https://dribbble.com/kylietimpani","https://www.facebook.com/Humaan","https://github.com/FrancisVillarba","https://www.instagram.com/curtindesign2020/","https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-brouse-7890372a/","https://twitter.com/weareanthologie","https://vimeo.com/bphoton","https://www.youtube.com/c/ChilledCow","https://bitbucket.org/aj_may/","https://codepen.io/naomigunton","https://polycount.com/profile/discussions/naomiguntonprofile","https://jhnmyr.tumblr.com/"],"majors":[{"id":"SY1ApOdJzRd0TmSzkIz5","title":"Creative Advertising"}],"id":"u8HpDDMm4rtTMJvovC48","bio":"I am an ocean-loving, tree-hugging, passionate aspiring creative with a flare for strong imaginative advertisements, that are both humorous and impactful.
